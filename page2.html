<div class="T1">
<dt>Super-Set</dt>
<br>
<p> is a combination of two or three moves that either work the same bodypart or opposing muscle groups, 
    and the exercises are done back to back with no rest in between.
    Between supersets you rest only long enough to recover and catch your breath, then hit it again. This helps you save time, 
    burn fat and spike your metabolism.</p></div>


<div class="T2">
<dt>Giant-Set</dt>
<br>
<p>is a circuit of four or more moves for one bodypart performed one after another with little to no rest in between.
     which is used to increase the intensity of a workout by overloading a muscle group
     and pushing it to its limit to burn fat and boost the cardiorespiratory response.</p></div>


<div class="T3">
<dt>Drop-Set</dt>
<br>
 <p>drop set is basically an extended set of a move, usually performed as the last set of that exercise as a burnout. 
    For the seated dumbbell shoulder press, for example, you’d do two sets of 10-12 reps using a certain weight. 
    For your third set you’d begin with the same weight and do as many reps as you can, then “drop” or reduce the weight and go to failure, 
    then drop the weight once more and rep out until you can’t lift the weight anymore. This kind of technique can not only boost the intensity of a set 
    but also bring up a lagging bodypart and burn more calories.</p></div>



<div class="T4">
<dt>Multi-Hold Pump Set</dt>
<br>
<p>This technique takes pain to a new level. 
   It's best done at the very end of a training session. You should only do one set. 
   This method loads up the muscle with tons of local growth factors, 
   as well as hyper-saturating it with amino acids.</p></div>



<div class="T5">
<dt>Tempo Contrast</dt>
<br>
<p>The technique itself is very simple: During the same set you alternate between very slow reps and fast reps
   This method recruits more muscle fibers due to the different types of rep contractions. 
   which leads to the release of growth factors that stimulate protein synthesis and muscle growth.</p></div>
