       <p> Bodybuilding is a discipline and an art that consists mainly of developing muscle mass  for aesthetic purposes.
            
       The bodybuilder's preparation consists mainly of strength training, rest, and a strict control of the diet 
       
       (usually high in calories and protein but which evolve according to the athlete is in a cycle of mass gaining or dry).
       
       Professional bodybuilders expose the fruit of their work during competitions during which they must parade before 
       
       a jury that assesses their muscle development and awards them points.
       
       Originally a male-only sport, women began to compete in separate competitions in the 1980s.
       
       Bodybuilding should not be confused with sports competitions of strength and athletic strength,

       where it is pure strength that is evaluated,
       
       and with weightlifting where we pay as much attention to strength physical than to the technique.
